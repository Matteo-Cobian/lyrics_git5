## IMPLEMENTATION of a SONG LYRICS FETCHER :music:


In this repository you can find a file named ```lyrics.py``` that queries the [lyrics.ovh](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#) website to fetch the lyrics of a song. 

!!!(TO BE MENTIONED EVENTUAL FURTHER FUNCTIONALITIES)

To do that the file ```lyrics.py``` implements the ```get_lyric( artist, title)``` function. 



If you run the program, executing the main file with: ```python main.py``` it will give you results similar to the following: 

```
$ python main.py
Across the Universe by Beatles:
Words are flowing out like 
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.
...
```

:warning: Note that the project requires the following modules to run: ```json``` , ```requests```, ```argparse```, ```sys``` modules. 

A user can choose, ```title``` ( **Across the Universe** in the example) by the specified ```artist``` (**Beatles** in the example) in order to get as output the lyrics.

** AUTHENTICATION **

Descrizione divisione packages e moduli e aggiungerei anche 
The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat directories containing the file as packages: just ignore it!
